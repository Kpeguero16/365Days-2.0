# 356---2.0
I will make my 365 idea but in HTML + JavaScript this time. I think it will be better this way. 

Here's the original README:

I got the idea a couple of hours ago so I just put a few lines of code and a text file with the basic idea for the project. I have exactly 10 days to finish this and the other gifts I'm preparing for Maria so... let's see.

-Video game style interactive app with ascii art 
-Take Maria through various stages from our relationship
-and various key/funny moments 
-"Which month would you like to explore" get input and show cool stuff about January(example)
